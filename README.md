USE HEADPHONES FOR BEST EFFECT (Background score would be bit uncomfortable for some players but other effects like bomb exploding are worth listening to..).

ADJUST CAMERA ANGLES ACCORDING TO YOUR NEED. I HAVE TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE IT COMFORTABLE.


AIM OF THE GAME:
Aim of the game is to kill all the enemies and then reach final plank where you can see your master along with evil scientist. You need to kill evil
scientist and get master home.

HOW TO DO IT?
You'll spawn in level 1 by default, you can choose which level to play from the button displayed on top saying level 1 and level 2. I have added tips button too, because
I think if the player thinks the game is too easy initially, then he'll have tough time later. As the scientist attacks takes away 15 of your health. So you can check
the tips from the game itself. I added help button, so that user can check controls from the game itself. Time left is on the top. YOU HAVE TO COMPLETE THE GAME WITHIN
STIPULATED TIME TO WIN. It's not easy but doable.
In level 1  you start from the top plank, your aim is to come down of the planks killing each and every enemy in the way. Enemy will drop bombs near you. Some bombs are
powerful than others so as an EFFECT OF POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODING NEAR PLAYER, PLAYER WILL BE THROWN AWAY FROM THE PLANK. so try to avoid being too close to enemy while
dropping bomb, because if you miss killing any enemy you won't win. And in level 1 you won't be able to climb the planks again, as height of the planks are designed to avoid
player going back to win. ENEMIES CAN'T SEE YOU DIRECTLY, SO TRY TO BE DISCRETE.
In level 2, there are 7 enemies and one main evil scientist, you need to kill everybody to win the game, you need to find all the enemies, YOU CAN'T MISS ANY ENEMIES.
As the environment is made in such a way that enemy can hide and drop bomb to attack you. so try to avoid that type of attack to save your health.  ENEMIES CAN SEE YOU NOW,
so they will deliver some dialogues, that you can read on the bottom of the screen. SAVE HEALTH FOR SCIENTIST, AS SCIENTIST IS BRUTAL WITH ATTACK, AND DIFFICULT TO kill.
That's all the help you'll need in the game. If you have read the whole document than I appreciate your effort and I'll give you one big tip to win this game. don't avoid
that health coin on the end of level 1. If you spawn to level 2 directly than kill all the enemies on the ground and then climb to level 1 stairs and get that health coin as
it's the only coin that will fill your health to 100 and believe me you'll need health in fighting scientist.
